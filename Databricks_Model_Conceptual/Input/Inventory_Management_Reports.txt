Analytical Reporting Requirements for Inventory Management 

 
Following are the reporting requirements of the Inventory Management Manager to take decisions on a  daily basis. An Analytical Data model is to be developed by understanding these reporting requirements. 

1. Inventory Stock Levels Report 

Objectives of the Report:
To provide visibility into the current stock levels across different warehouses and ensure inventory is maintained within optimal levels to avoid stockouts or overstocking. 

Uses of the Report:
Identify products nearing stockout levels for timely replenishment. Highlight overstocked products that may require redistribution. Track trends in inventory usage for planning purposes. 

Data Attributes in the Report:
Product name, category, and stock level. Warehouse name and location. Minimum and maximum threshold levels. Stock replenishment status (below, optimal, overstocked). 

KPIs and Metrics in the Report:
Days of Inventory Remaining (based on sales velocity). Stockout percentage (per warehouse or product). Overstock percentage. 

Interactivity in the Report:
Drill Down: From total inventory by product category to individual product details. Drill Through: Link to stock adjustment history for specific products. Drill Up: Aggregate inventory levels by warehouse or region. 

Calculations in the Report:
Reorder point = Average daily sales × Lead time. Overstock percentage = (Current stock - Max threshold) / Max threshold × 100. Days of Inventory Remaining = Current stock / Average daily sales. 

Data Constraints:
* Product Name: Must be unique within the system.
* Stock Level: Must be a non-negative integer.
* Minimum and Maximum Threshold Levels: Must be positive integers, with the minimum threshold less than the maximum threshold.
* Stock Replenishment Status: Must be one of the predefined values: "Below", "Optimal", "Overstocked".
* Prevent duplicate entries for unique fields

Validations:
* Ensure that the Days of Inventory Remaining calculation does not result in a negative value.
* Validate that the Overstock Percentage is calculated correctly and does not exceed 100% unless explicitly allowed.
* Ensure that the Reorder Point is calculated based on valid historical sales data and lead time.

Security Access for the Report:
Warehouse managers can view their specific warehouse data only. Inventory managers can access consolidated data across all warehouses. Executives can view aggregate insights for strategic decision-making.

Validations:
* Ensure that the On-Time Delivery Rate is calculated correctly and does not exceed 100%.
* Validate that the Defective Items Percentage is based on the total items ordered and not just the delivered items.
* Ensure that the Supplier Fulfillment Rate is consistent with the total purchase order value and rejected items.

Security Access for the Report:

3. Sales and Inventory Correlation Report 

Objectives of the Report: 
Analyze the relationship between sales trends and inventory levels to optimize stock management and reduce wastage. 

Uses of the Report:
Identify fast-moving and slow-moving products. Forecast inventory requirements based on sales patterns. Reduce inventory holding costs. 

Data Attributes in the Report:
Product name, sales quantity, and inventory levels. Warehouse and region. Sales trends over time. 

KPIs and Metrics in the Report:
Inventory Turnover Ratio. Fast-Moving vs. Slow-Moving Product Ratio. Average Days to Sell Inventory. 

Interactivity in the Report:
Drill Down: From total sales by category to individual product sales trends. Drill Through: Link to inventory adjustment history for specific products. Drill Up: Aggregate sales and inventory metrics by region or warehouse. 

Calculations in the Report:
Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory. Average Days to Sell = 365 / Inventory Turnover Ratio. 

Data Constraints:
* Product Name: Must be unique and non-null.
* Sales Quantity: Must be a non-negative integer.
* Inventory Levels: Must be a non-negative integer.
