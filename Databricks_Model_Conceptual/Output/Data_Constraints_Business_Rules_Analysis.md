# Data Constraints and Business Rules Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document addresses the situation where Mode 2 (Update Conceptual Data Model Workflow) was requested (Do_You_Need_Any_Changes: Yes), but the required input files and existing conceptual data model files could not be located in the GitHub repositories.

## Current Situation Analysis

### Missing Files Investigation

**Input Repository Search Results:**
- Repository: karthik061299/Databricks
- Target File: Process_Sales_Data_Procedure.txt
- Search Paths Attempted:
  - Input/Process_Sales_Data_Procedure.txt
  - Process_Sales_Data_Procedure.txt
- Status: File not found

**Output Repository Search Results:**
- Repository: karthik061299/Databricks
- Target Files: Existing conceptual data model files
- Search Paths Attempted:
  - Databricks_Model_Conceptual/Output/Process_Sales_Data_Procedure_Conceptual_1.md
  - Output/Process_Sales_Data_Procedure_Conceptual_1.md
- Status: Files not found

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Steps

1. **Verify Repository Structure**
   - Confirm the correct repository paths for input and output directories
   - Validate GitHub access permissions
   - Check if files exist in different branches

2. **Establish Baseline Requirements**
   - Create initial data constraints framework
   - Define standard business rules template
   - Establish data quality expectations

### Data Constraints Framework

#### 1. Data Quality Constraints

**Completeness Constraints:**
- All mandatory fields must be populated
- No null values in primary key columns
- Required business attributes must have valid values

**Accuracy Constraints:**
- Data format validation (dates, numbers, text)
- Range validation for numeric fields
- Pattern matching for structured data (emails, phone numbers)

**Consistency Constraints:**
- Cross-table referential integrity
- Business rule consistency across related entities
- Temporal consistency for time-series data

**Uniqueness Constraints:**
- Primary key uniqueness
- Business key uniqueness where applicable
- Composite key constraints

#### 2. Business Rules Framework

**Entity-Level Rules:**
- Customer data must include valid contact information
- Product data must have active status and valid pricing
- Transaction data must have valid timestamps and amounts

**Relationship Rules:**
- Orders must be associated with valid customers
- Order items must reference valid products
- Payment records must link to valid orders

**Temporal Rules:**
- Order dates cannot be in the future
- Delivery dates must be after order dates
- Product effective dates must be properly sequenced

#### 3. Data Governance Constraints

**Security Constraints:**
- PII data encryption requirements
- Access control restrictions
- Data masking rules for non-production environments

**Compliance Constraints:**
- GDPR compliance for customer data
- Financial reporting standards compliance
- Industry-specific regulatory requirements

**Retention Constraints:**
- Data retention periods by entity type
- Archival requirements
- Deletion policies for expired data

### Sales Data Specific Constraints (Template)

#### Customer Entity Constraints
```
Constraint Type: Business Rule
Entity: Customer
Rule: Customer ID must be unique and non-null
Validation: LENGTH(customer_id) > 0 AND customer_id IS NOT NULL
Error Handling: Reject record with error code CUS001
```

#### Sales Transaction Constraints
```
Constraint Type: Data Quality
Entity: Sales_Transaction
Rule: Transaction amount must be positive
Validation: transaction_amount > 0
Error Handling: Flag for review with warning code TXN001
```

#### Product Constraints
```
Constraint Type: Referential Integrity
Entity: Product
Rule: Product category must exist in Category master
Validation: product_category_id IN (SELECT category_id FROM Category)
Error Handling: Reject with error code PRD001
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Create input directory structure in GitHub
2. Upload Process_Sales_Data_Procedure.txt to Input folder
3. Establish output directory for conceptual models

### Phase 2: Constraint Development
1. Analyze business requirements from procedure document
2. Map data elements to constraint categories
3. Define validation rules and error handling

### Phase 3: Model Integration
1. Integrate constraints into conceptual data model
2. Create constraint validation framework
3. Establish monitoring and alerting mechanisms

## Next Steps for Update Mode

When the required files become available:

1. **Read Input Requirements**
   - Parse Process_Sales_Data_Procedure.txt
   - Extract business rules and data requirements
   - Identify constraint categories

2. **Analyze Existing Model**
   - Review current conceptual data model
   - Identify gaps in constraint coverage
   - Map change requirements to constraint updates

3. **Update Constraints**
   - Modify existing business rules
   - Add new data quality constraints
   - Update validation logic

4. **Generate Updated Model**
   - Create revised conceptual data model
   - Include updated constraint specifications
   - Document change rationale and impact

## Conclusion

While the requested files for Mode 2 update are currently unavailable, this document provides a comprehensive framework for data constraints and business rules that can be applied once the necessary input files and existing models are accessible. The framework ensures data integrity, compliance, and quality standards are maintained throughout the conceptual data modeling process.
