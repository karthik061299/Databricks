- **Category Classifications**: Consistent product categorization hierarchy

## 2. Constraints

### 2.1 Mandatory Field Constraints
- **Product Name**: Required, cannot be null or empty
- **Warehouse Name**: Required, cannot be null or empty
- **Supplier Name**: Required, cannot be null or empty
- **Stock Level**: Required, must be present for all active products
- **Sales Quantity**: Required for all sales transactions

### 2.2 Uniqueness Constraints
- **Product Name**: Must be unique within the system
- **Warehouse Name**: Must be unique across all locations
- **Supplier Name**: Must be unique in supplier master data
- **Purchase Order ID**: Must be unique for each order
- **Sales Transaction ID**: Must be unique for each transaction

### 2.3 Data Type Constraints
- **Stock Level**: Non-negative integer values only
- **Warehouse Capacity**: Positive numeric values (square feet or cubic meters)
- **Utilized Space**: Non-negative numeric, cannot exceed total capacity
- **Average Delivery Time**: Positive numeric values in days
- **Sales Quantity**: Non-negative integer values
- **Purchase Order Value**: Positive monetary values
- **Percentage Fields**: Values between 0% and 100% (0.00 to 1.00 in decimal)

### 2.4 Range Constraints
- **Minimum Threshold Level**: Must be positive integer, less than maximum threshold
- **Maximum Threshold Level**: Must be positive integer, greater than minimum threshold
- **Order Fulfillment Rate**: Must be between 0% and 100%
- **Rejected Items Percentage**: Must be between 0% and 100%
- **Delayed Delivery Percentage**: Must be between 0% and 100%
- **Warehouse Utilization Rate**: Must be between 0% and 100%
- **Forecast Accuracy**: Must be between 0% and 100%

### 2.5 Dependency Constraints
- **Reorder Point Calculation**: Requires valid Average Daily Sales and Lead Time values
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: Requires valid Cost of Goods Sold and Average Inventory values
- **Demand Forecast**: Requires minimum 12 months of historical sales data
- **Supplier Performance**: Requires minimum 3 months of order history
- **Warehouse Utilization**: Utilized Space cannot exceed Total Capacity

### 2.6 Referential Integrity Constraints
- **Product-Category Relationship**: Every product must belong to a valid category
- **Inventory-Warehouse Relationship**: Every inventory record must reference a valid warehouse
- **Sales-Product Relationship**: Every sales transaction must reference a valid product
- **Purchase Order-Supplier Relationship**: Every purchase order must reference a valid supplier
- **Shipment-Purchase Order Relationship**: Every shipment must reference a valid purchase order

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Inventory Management Rules
- **Stock Replenishment Status**: Automatically determined based on current stock vs. threshold levels
  - "Below": Current stock < Minimum threshold
  - "Optimal": Minimum threshold ≤ Current stock ≤ Maximum threshold
  - "Overstocked": Current stock > Maximum threshold
- **Reorder Point Trigger**: Automatic reorder recommendations when stock reaches reorder point
- **Safety Stock Maintenance**: Minimum 7 days of safety stock for critical products
- **Obsolete Inventory**: Products with zero sales for 180 days flagged for review

### 3.2 Supplier Performance Rules
- **Supplier Rating Classification**:
  - "Excellent": On-time delivery >95%, Defective items <2%
  - "Good": On-time delivery 85-95%, Defective items 2-5%
  - "Average": On-time delivery 70-85%, Defective items 5-10%
  - "Poor": On-time delivery <70%, Defective items >10%
- **Supplier Review Frequency**: Monthly for poor performers, quarterly for others
- **New Supplier Evaluation**: Minimum 3-month probation period with enhanced monitoring

### 3.3 Warehouse Utilization Rules
- **Optimal Utilization Range**: Target 75-85% capacity utilization
- **Underutilization Alert**: Trigger when utilization falls below 60%
- **Overutilization Alert**: Trigger when utilization exceeds 90%
- **Space Allocation Priority**: Fast-moving products get prime locations
- **Seasonal Adjustment**: Reserve 15% capacity for seasonal demand spikes

### 3.4 Sales and Inventory Correlation Rules
- **Product Classification by Movement**:
  - "Fast-Moving": Inventory turnover >12 times per year
  - "Medium-Moving": Inventory turnover 4-12 times per year
  - "Slow-Moving": Inventory turnover <4 times per year
- **Stock Adjustment Triggers**: Automatic adjustments for products with >20% variance
- **Seasonal Pattern Recognition**: Identify products with >30% seasonal variation

### 3.5 Demand Forecasting Rules
- **Forecast Horizon**: Generate forecasts for 3, 6, and 12-month periods
- **Model Selection**: Use different algorithms based on product characteristics
- **Seasonal Adjustment**: Apply seasonal factors for products with historical patterns
- **Trend Analysis**: Incorporate growth/decline trends in forecast calculations
- **Forecast Review**: Monthly review and adjustment of forecast parameters

### 3.6 Data Processing Rules
- **Data Refresh Frequency**:
  - Stock levels: Real-time updates
  - Sales data: Daily batch processing
  - Supplier performance: Weekly updates
  - Demand forecasts: Monthly regeneration
- **Data Validation Sequence**: Validate constraints before business rule application
- **Exception Handling**: Log and flag all constraint violations for manual review
- **Data Quality Scoring**: Assign quality scores based on completeness and accuracy

### 3.7 Reporting Logic Rules
- **KPI Calculation Timing**: All KPIs calculated using end-of-day snapshots
- **Aggregation Rules**: Consistent aggregation methods across all reports
- **Drill-down Hierarchy**: Maintain consistent navigation paths across reports
- **Security Filtering**: Apply role-based data filtering before report generation
- **Historical Comparison**: Always include previous period comparisons for trend analysis

### 3.8 Data Transformation Guidelines
- **Currency Conversion**: Use daily exchange rates for multi-currency operations
- **Unit Standardization**: Convert all measurements to standard units before calculations
- **Time Zone Handling**: All timestamps converted to corporate standard time zone
- **Data Cleansing**: Apply standardized cleansing rules for text fields
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Use business-approved methods for handling null values
