- **Maximum Threshold Level**: Must be positive integer and > Minimum Threshold Level
- **Warehouse Utilization Rate**: Must be percentage between 0% and 100%
- **Forecast Accuracy**: Must be percentage between 0% and 100%
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: Must be positive number (> 0)
- **Days of Inventory Remaining**: Must be non-negative number (≥ 0)

### 2.5 Referential Integrity Constraints
- **Product-Inventory Relationship**: All inventory records must reference valid existing products
- **Warehouse-Stock Relationship**: All stock records must reference valid existing warehouses
- **Supplier-Purchase Order Relationship**: All purchase orders must reference valid existing suppliers
- **Product-Sales Relationship**: All sales transactions must reference valid existing products
- **Warehouse-Sales Relationship**: All sales transactions must reference valid existing warehouses

### 2.6 Dependency Constraints
- **Reorder Point Calculation**: Requires valid Average Daily Sales and Lead Time values
- **Overstock Percentage Calculation**: Requires valid Current Stock and Maximum Threshold values
- **Warehouse Utilization Calculation**: Requires valid Utilized Space and Total Capacity values
- **Forecast Accuracy Calculation**: Requires both Predicted and Actual Demand values
- **Inventory Turnover Calculation**: Requires valid Cost of Goods Sold and Average Inventory values

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Inventory Management Rules
- **Stock Replenishment Rule**: When current stock level falls below minimum threshold, automatic reorder point calculation must be triggered
- **Overstock Prevention Rule**: When current stock level exceeds maximum threshold by 20%, alert must be generated for redistribution consideration
- **Stockout Prevention Rule**: Products with less than 7 days of inventory remaining must be flagged for urgent replenishment
- **Seasonal Adjustment Rule**: Minimum and maximum thresholds must be adjusted based on seasonal demand patterns
- **Lead Time Buffer Rule**: Reorder point must include safety stock buffer of 25% of lead time demand

### 3.2 Supplier Performance Rules
- **Supplier Evaluation Rule**: Suppliers with on-time delivery rate below 85% must be flagged for performance review
- **Quality Control Rule**: Suppliers with defective items percentage above 5% must undergo quality audit
- **Preferred Supplier Rule**: Suppliers with fulfillment rate above 95% and on-time delivery above 90% qualify for preferred status
- **Supplier Diversification Rule**: No single supplier should account for more than 40% of total procurement value
- **Performance Monitoring Rule**: Supplier metrics must be evaluated monthly and annually for contract renewals

### 3.3 Warehouse Operations Rules
- **Capacity Management Rule**: Warehouse utilization should not exceed 85% to maintain operational efficiency
- **Space Allocation Rule**: Fast-moving products must be allocated to easily accessible warehouse locations
- **Cross-Docking Rule**: Products with high turnover ratio (>12) should be considered for cross-docking operations
