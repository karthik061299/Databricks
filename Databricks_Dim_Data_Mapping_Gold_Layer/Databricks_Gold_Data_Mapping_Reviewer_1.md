# Databricks Gold Data Mapping Reviewer
## Inventory Management System - Gold Layer Review

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive review of the Gold Layer Data Mapping for the Inventory Management System. The review encompasses data mapping accuracy, consistency validation, transformation logic, data quality rules, and compliance with Microsoft Databricks best practices. The assessment evaluates the transformation from Silver Layer to Gold Layer dimension tables including Go_Product_Dimension, Go_Warehouse_Dimension, Go_Supplier_Dimension, Go_Customer_Dimension, and Go_Date_Dimension.

## 2. Review Methodology

The review was conducted using the following criteria:
- **Data Mapping Review**: Verification of Silver to Gold layer table mappings
- **Data Consistency Validation**: Field-level mapping accuracy and consistency
- **Dimension Attribute Transformations**: Category mappings and hierarchy structures
- **Data Validation Rules Assessment**: Deduplication logic and format standardization
- **Data Cleansing Review**: Missing value handling and duplicate removal
- **Databricks Best Practices Compliance**: Adherence to recommended guidelines
- **Business Requirements Alignment**: Validation against conceptual model and constraints

## 3. Detailed Review Results

### 3.1 Data Mapping Review

✅ **Correctly mapped Silver to Gold Layer tables**
- All five dimension tables (Go_Product_Dimension, Go_Warehouse_Dimension, Go_Supplier_Dimension, Go_Customer_Dimension, Go_Date_Dimension) are properly mapped from Silver layer sources
- Source-to-target field mappings are comprehensive and well-documented
- Surrogate key generation using ROW_NUMBER() and DENSE_RANK() functions is correctly implemented
- Business key transformations (product_code, warehouse_code, supplier_code, customer_code) follow consistent naming conventions

✅ **Transformation rules are properly defined**
- Each transformation includes detailed SQL examples with proper Spark SQL syntax
- Field-level transformations are documented with validation rules and business logic
- SCD Type 2 implementation is correctly designed with effective dates and current flags

❌ **Minor gaps identified**
- Some system-generated fields lack detailed transformation logic documentation
- Cross-reference validation between dimension tables could be enhanced

### 3.2 Data Consistency Validation

✅ **Properly mapped fields ensuring consistency**
- All mandatory fields from Silver layer are correctly mapped to Gold layer
- Data type conversions are appropriate (INT to BIGINT for IDs, proper VARCHAR lengths)
- Consistent metadata fields (load_date, update_date, source_system) across all tables
- Standardized naming conventions applied throughout all dimension tables

✅ **Field validation rules are comprehensive**
- NOT NULL constraints properly identified for critical business fields
- Format validations implemented for email, phone, and code fields
- Range validations applied where appropriate (dates, percentages, quantities)

❌ **Areas for improvement**
- Some derived fields lack explicit validation against source constraints
- Cross-dimensional referential integrity checks could be strengthened

### 3.3 Dimension Attribute Transformations

✅ **Correct category mappings and hierarchy structures**
- Product category hierarchy mapping from single category field to category_name and subcategory_name is well-designed
- Warehouse type classification based on capacity thresholds follows logical business rules
- Supplier rating derivation based on activity dates provides meaningful business value
- Customer segmentation logic supports analytical requirements

✅ **Standardization transformations are appropriate**
- INITCAP function used consistently for name standardization
- Email addresses converted to lowercase with format validation
- Phone number validation using RLIKE patterns
- Address parsing logic for warehouse locations is comprehensive

❌ **Enhancement opportunities**
- Product brand extraction logic could be more sophisticated to handle complex product names
- Category mapping could benefit from a lookup table approach for better maintainability

### 3.4 Data Validation Rules Assessment

✅ **Deduplication logic and format standardization applied correctly**
- SCD Type 2 implementation prevents duplicate active records
- Surrogate key generation ensures uniqueness across historical versions
- Format standardization rules consistently applied (INITCAP, UPPER, LOWER functions)
- Date format validations ensure consistency (YYYY-MM-DD format)

✅ **Comprehensive validation framework**
- Email validation using proper regex patterns
- Phone number validation with appropriate character sets
- Null value handling with appropriate default values
- Business rule validations for status derivations

❌ **Areas needing attention**
- Some validation rules could benefit from more sophisticated error handling
- Data quality scoring mechanisms could be enhanced

### 3.5 Data Cleansing Review

✅ **Proper handling of missing values and duplicates**
- NULL value handling with meaningful defaults (e.g., 'UNKNOWN_PRODUCT', 'UNKNOWN_SUPPLIER')
- Empty string validation and replacement logic
- Capacity validation with reasonable bounds (1000 to 1,000,000)
- Default value assignments for system-generated fields

✅ **Cleansing logic is comprehensive**
- TRIM functions applied to remove leading/trailing spaces
- REGEXP_REPLACE used for data standardization
- Length validations prevent empty or invalid entries
- Special character handling in supplier names

❌ **Minor improvements needed**
- Some cleansing rules could be more configurable
- Advanced outlier detection could be implemented

### 3.6 Compliance with Microsoft Databricks Best Practices

✅ **Fully adheres to Databricks best practices**
- Delta Lake format used for all tables with ACID transaction support
- Proper partitioning strategies implemented (date-based for facts, logical for dimensions)
- Z-ORDER optimization recommendations provided for query performance
- Auto-optimization features enabled (optimizeWrite, autoCompact)
- Appropriate use of Spark SQL functions throughout transformations

✅ **Performance optimization implemented**
- Broadcast join recommendations for dimension lookups
- Incremental loading strategies documented
- Proper data types selected for Databricks environment
- Storage optimization through tiered storage strategies

✅ **Data governance features**

- Business rules from constraints document correctly implemented
- KPI requirements supported through proper attribute design
- Hierarchical relationships maintained (product categories, warehouse types)

✅ **Analytical requirements supported**
- Product hierarchy enables drill-down analysis
- Customer segmentation supports targeted analysis
- Supplier performance tracking capabilities implemented
- Time-based analysis supported through comprehensive date dimension
