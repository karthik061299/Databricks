# Conceptual Data Model for Inventory Management Reports

## 1. Domain Overview

This conceptual data model supports the Inventory Management domain, focusing on stock management, supplier performance evaluation, sales-inventory correlation analysis, warehouse utilization optimization, and demand forecasting. The model enables comprehensive reporting across five key areas: inventory stock levels, supplier performance, sales and inventory correlation, warehouse utilization, and product demand forecasting.

3. **Supplier** - External vendors who provide products to the organization with performance tracking capabilities
4. **Inventory** - Current stock levels and status of products across different warehouses
5. **Sales** - Historical and current sales transactions and quantities for products
6. **Purchase Order** - Orders placed with suppliers for product procurement
7. **Delivery** - Shipment and delivery information for purchase orders
8. **Demand Forecast** - Predictive data for future product demand based on historical patterns
