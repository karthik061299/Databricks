## 1. Visual Recommendations

| Data Element                   | SQL Query                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Recommended Visual     | Data Fields                             | Calculations     | Interactivity                        | Justification                                                        | Optimization Tips                       |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Inventory Turnover Analysis   | SELECT category, SUM(quantity_on_hand) AS total_stock, SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_sold, (SUM(quantity_sold)/SUM(quantity_on_hand)) AS turnover_rate FROM inventory_facts JOIN product_dim ON inventory_facts.product_id = product_dim.product_id GROUP BY category | Bar Chart             | category, total_stock, total_sold, turnover_rate | SUM, division    | Filter by category, drill-down to SKU | Bar chart is ideal for comparing turnover rates across categories     | Partition by date_key, cache product_dim |
| Stock Level Monitoring        | SELECT warehouse_id, SUM(quantity_on_hand) AS current_stock, SUM(reorder_point) AS reorder_point, SUM(safety_stock) AS safety_stock FROM inventory_facts GROUP BY warehouse_id                                                      | KPI Card, Table       | warehouse_id, current_stock, reorder_point, safety_stock | SUM             | Filter by warehouse, drill-through to product | KPI cards highlight critical stock metrics, table provides details    | Z-order by warehouse_id, cache joins     |
| Demand Forecasting Dashboard  | SELECT product_id, region, AVG(predicted_demand) AS avg_demand, AVG(forecast_accuracy) AS accuracy FROM demand_forecast GROUP BY product_id, region                                                                                 | Line Chart, Table     | product_id, region, avg_demand, accuracy | AVG              | Filter by region, time period, scenario modeling | Line chart shows trends, table for accuracy                           | Partition by region, cache forecast table|
| Inventory Aging               | SELECT product_id, DATEDIFF(current_date, received_date) AS days_in_inventory FROM inventory_facts                                                                                                                                | Histogram, Box Plot   | product_id, days_in_inventory            | DATEDIFF         | Filter by product, drill-down to warehouse | Histogram/box plot for distribution analysis                          | Partition by received_date               |
| Stockout Events               | SELECT date_key, COUNT(*) AS stockout_events FROM inventory_facts WHERE quantity_on_hand = 0 GROUP BY date_key                                                                              | Area Chart            | date_key, stockout_events                | COUNT            | Filter by date, drill-down to category | Area chart for cumulative events                                       | Partition by date_key                    |

## 2. Overall Dashboard Design

### Layout Suggestions
- Top row: KPI cards for current stock, reorder point, safety stock
- Middle: Bar chart for turnover analysis, line chart for demand forecasting
- Bottom: Table for detailed metrics, histogram/box plot for aging analysis
- Sidebar: Filters for category, warehouse, time period

### Query Optimization
- Use Delta Lake for all tables
- Partition large fact tables by date_key, region
- Cache dimension tables for frequent joins
- Z-order by product_id and warehouse_id for efficient filtering
- Use bucketing for high-cardinality columns

### Color Scheme
- Use organization branding colors for consistency
- Bar/line charts: blue, green, orange for differentiation
- KPI cards: red for critical, green for healthy, yellow for warning

### Typography
- Use sans-serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Helvetica) for readability
- Bold for KPI values, regular for labels
- Consistent font sizes across dashboard

### Interactive Elements

| Feature        | Description                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Filters        | Category, warehouse, time period, region       |
| Slicers        | Product, supplier                              |
| Drill-through  | From summary to detailed SKU or warehouse view |
| Drill up/down  | Aggregate by category, drill down to SKU       |

## Tips & Pitfalls
- Avoid inefficient joins by caching dimension tables
- Monitor query performance for large shuffles and skewed data
- Use Delta Lake optimization features (Z-order, partitioning)
- Keep dashboard layout simple for usability
- Regularly review metrics and filters for business relevance
