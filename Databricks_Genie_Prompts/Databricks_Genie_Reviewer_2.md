## 1. Visual Prompt Review & Recommendations

| # | Prompt                                                                                          | Visual Type      | Data Fields                                 | Aggregations/Calculations           | Interactivity Features                  | Rationale & Best Practices                |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Create a bar chart to compare inventory turnover rates across product categories.                | Bar Chart        | category, total_stock, total_sold, turnover_rate | SUM, division                      | Filter by category, drill-down to SKU    | Bar chart ideal for categorical comparison. Use clear axis labels, legend, and color differentiation. |
| 2 | Add KPI cards for current stock, reorder point, and safety stock by warehouse.                  | KPI Card         | warehouse_id, current_stock, reorder_point, safety_stock | SUM                                | Filter by warehouse, drill-through       | KPI cards highlight critical metrics. Use color coding (red/yellow/green) for status. |
| 3 | Add a line chart to visualize demand forecast trends by product and region.                      | Line Chart       | product_id, region, avg_demand, accuracy     | AVG                                 | Filter by region, time period            | Line chart for trend analysis. Use time on X-axis, legend for regions. |
| 4 | Add a histogram to show distribution of inventory aging (days in inventory) by product.          | Histogram        | product_id, days_in_inventory                | DATEDIFF                            | Filter by product, drill-down to warehouse| Histogram for distribution analysis. Use bins, axis labels. |
| 5 | Add an area chart to display stockout events over time.                                          | Area Chart       | date_key, stockout_events                    | COUNT                               | Filter by date, drill-down to category   | Area chart for cumulative events. Use time axis, color for event severity. |
| 6 | Add a table for detailed inventory metrics by product and warehouse.                             | Table            | product_id, warehouse_id, current_stock, reorder_point, safety_stock, turnover_rate | SUM, division                      | Sort, filter, drill-through              | Table for granular details. Ensure sortable columns, clear formatting. |

## 2. Additional Visuals for Richer Insights

| # | Prompt                                                                                          | Visual Type      | Data Fields                                 | Aggregations/Calculations           | Interactivity Features                  | Rationale & Best Practices                |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 7 | Add a scatter plot to analyze correlation between forecast accuracy and turnover rate by product.| Scatter Plot     | product_id, accuracy, turnover_rate          | None                                | Filter by product, region                | Scatter plot for correlation analysis. Use tooltips, axis labels. |
| 8 | Add a pie chart to visualize composition of inventory by category (top 5 categories).            | Pie Chart        | category, total_stock                        | SUM                                 | Filter by category                       | Pie chart for part-to-whole analysis. Limit to â‰¤5 categories for clarity. |
| 9 | Add a tree map to show hierarchical breakdown of inventory by category and sub-category.         | Tree Map         | category, sub_category, total_stock          | SUM                                 | Drill-down to sub-category               | Tree map for nested categories. Use color and size for hierarchy. |

## 3. Dashboard Layout & Formatting
- **Top Row**: KPI cards for stock metrics
- **Middle**: Bar chart (turnover), line chart (forecast), area chart (stockouts)
- **Bottom**: Table (details), histogram (aging), scatter plot (correlation)
- **Sidebar**: Filters for category, warehouse, region, time period
- **Color Scheme**: Use organization branding; differentiate visuals with blue, green, orange; KPI status with red/yellow/green
- **Typography**: Sans-serif fonts, bold for KPIs, consistent sizes
- **Titles/Labels**: Each visual must have clear title, axis labels, legend

---

## 4. Data Field & Transformation Validation
- All prompts include necessary fields from the physical model and inventory tables
- Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, DATEDIFF, division) are specified for each visual
- Filters and drill-throughs are defined for interactivity
- Calculations (turnover rate, aging) are clearly described

---

## 5. Dashboard Usability Enhancements
- **Filters**: Category, warehouse, region, time period
- **Slicers**: Product, supplier
- **Drill-through**: From summary to SKU/warehouse details
- **Drill up/down**: Aggregate by category, drill to SKU
- **Narratives**: Add KPI comparisons and trend commentary for storytelling

---

## 6. Performance & Optimization Best Practices
- Use Delta Lake for all tables
- Partition fact tables by date_key, region
- Cache dimension tables for frequent joins
- Z-order by product_id, warehouse_id for filtering
- Use bucketing for high-cardinality columns
- Monitor query performance and optimize joins

---
