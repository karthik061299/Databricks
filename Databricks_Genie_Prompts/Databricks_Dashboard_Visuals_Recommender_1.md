## Report Requirements Analysis

### Inventory Management Key Metrics
1. **Stock Levels**: Current inventory quantities by product/category
2. **Inventory Turnover**: Rate of inventory movement
3. **Reorder Points**: Items approaching minimum stock levels
4. **Cost Analysis**: Inventory valuation and cost trends
5. **Supplier Performance**: Lead times and delivery metrics
6. **Warehouse Utilization**: Space and capacity metrics
7. **Demand Forecasting**: Predictive inventory needs

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 3 seconds for interactive dashboards
- **Data Freshness**: Real-time to hourly updates
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 50+ simultaneous users
- **Data Volume**: Handle millions of inventory transactions

## Visual Recommendations by Report Type

### 1. Inventory Overview Dashboard

| Metric | Recommended Visual | Rationale | Query Optimization |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Total Inventory Value | Counter | Quick KPI visibility | Use pre-aggregated tables |
| Stock Levels by Category | Bar Chart | Easy comparison | Index on category_id |
| Inventory Trend (30 days) | Line Chart | Trend identification | Partition by date |
| Low Stock Alerts | Table | Actionable details | Filter on reorder_point |
| Top Moving Items | Bar Chart | Performance focus | Use materialized views |

### 2. Inventory Analysis Dashboard

| Metric | Recommended Visual | Rationale | Query Optimization |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Inventory Turnover Rate | Gauge | Performance indicator | Calculate in gold layer |
| ABC Analysis | Scatter Plot | Value vs. volume analysis | Pre-compute ABC categories |
| Seasonal Patterns | Heatmap | Pattern recognition | Aggregate by month/week |
| Supplier Performance | Bar Chart | Comparative analysis | Index on supplier_id |
| Cost Variance | Line Chart | Trend monitoring | Use delta tables |

### 3. Operational Dashboard

| Metric | Recommended Visual | Rationale | Query Optimization |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Warehouse Utilization | Gauge | Capacity monitoring | Real-time streaming |
| Inbound/Outbound Flow | Area Chart | Flow visualization | Partition by transaction_type |
| Order Fulfillment Rate | Counter | KPI tracking | Use window functions |
| Stock Movement Details | Table | Operational details | Implement pagination |
| Location Performance | Map | Geographic insights | Cache location data |

## Data Model Recommendations

### Gold Layer Optimizations
```sql
-- Recommended aggregation tables for dashboard performance
CREATE TABLE gold.inventory_daily_summary
USING DELTA
PARTITIONED BY (date_partition)
AS SELECT 
  date_partition,
  product_id,
  category_id,
  warehouse_id,
  SUM(quantity_on_hand) as total_quantity,
  SUM(inventory_value) as total_value,
  AVG(unit_cost) as avg_unit_cost
FROM gold.inventory_transactions
GROUP BY date_partition, product_id, category_id, warehouse_id
```

### Performance Optimization Strategies
1. **Partitioning**: Partition large tables by date and location
2. **Z-Ordering**: Optimize for common filter columns
3. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed dimension tables
4. **Materialized Views**: Pre-compute complex aggregations
5. **Delta Lake**: Leverage time travel and ACID transactions

## Dashboard Design Best Practices

### Layout Recommendations
1. **Top Row**: Key KPIs (Counters and Gauges)
2. **Middle Section**: Trend analysis (Line and Area charts)
3. **Bottom Section**: Detailed tables and drill-down options
4. **Right Panel**: Filters and parameter controls

### Color Scheme Guidelines
- **Green**: Positive metrics, adequate stock levels
- **Red**: Alerts, low stock, performance issues
- **Blue**: Neutral metrics, informational data
- **Orange**: Warnings, approaching thresholds

### Interactivity Features
- **Cross-filtering**: Enable dashboard-wide filtering
- **Drill-down**: Navigate from summary to detail views
- **Time range selection**: Dynamic date filtering
- **Export capabilities**: CSV and PDF export options

## Query Performance Guidelines

### SQL Optimization Techniques
```sql
-- Use window functions for ranking
SELECT 
  product_name,
  inventory_value,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY inventory_value DESC) as rank
FROM gold.product_inventory
WHERE date_partition = current_date()
LIMIT 10

-- Leverage Delta Lake features
SELECT *
FROM gold.inventory_snapshot
VERSION AS OF 1  -- Time travel for historical analysis

-- Use broadcast joins for small dimension tables
SELECT /*+ BROADCAST(categories) */
  i.product_id,
  c.category_name,
  SUM(i.quantity) as total_quantity
FROM inventory i
JOIN categories c ON i.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY i.product_id, c.category_name
```

### PySpark Optimization
```python
# Cache frequently used DataFrames
inventory_df = spark.table("gold.inventory_summary").cache()

# Use appropriate partitioning
inventory_df.write \
  .partitionBy("date_partition", "warehouse_id") \
  .mode("overwrite") \
  .saveAsTable("gold.inventory_partitioned")

# Optimize joins with broadcast
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast
result = large_df.join(broadcast(small_df), "key")
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Data Volume Management
- **Archiving Strategy**: Move historical data to cold storage
- **Incremental Processing**: Use Delta Lake merge operations
- **Compute Scaling**: Auto-scaling clusters for peak loads
- **Storage Optimization**: Regular OPTIMIZE and VACUUM operations

### User Concurrency
- **SQL Warehouses**: Use appropriate sizing for concurrent users
- **Query Result Caching**: Enable result caching for repeated queries
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute query load across multiple endpoints

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Metrics to Track
- Query execution time
- Dashboard load time
- Data freshness lag
- User adoption rates
- Error rates and failures

### Maintenance Schedule
- **Daily**: Monitor dashboard performance and data quality
- **Weekly**: Review query performance and optimize slow queries
- **Monthly**: Analyze usage patterns and update recommendations
- **Quarterly**: Review and update data model as needed
