# Databricks PySpark Unit Test Cases - Version 2
## Enhanced Bronze Layer Data Ingestion Pipeline - Inventory Management System

## 1. Test Case Overview

This document provides comprehensive unit test cases for the Enhanced Bronze Layer Data Ingestion Pipeline Version 2 that extracts data from multiple sources including PostgreSQL, Kafka streams, REST APIs, and cloud storage, loading them into Databricks Delta Lake format. The test cases cover happy path scenarios, edge cases, error handling, performance validation, security testing, schema evolution, and advanced data quality checks.
